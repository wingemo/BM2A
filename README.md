# BUSINESSMODEL2API

Within your BPMN model, these verbs represent actions related to your data storage references, symbolizing the various operations crucial to your process. Consequently, these verbs will be transformed into corresponding API endpoints as follows:

GET -> RETRIEVE
POST -> CREATE
PUT -> UPDATE
DELETE -> DELETE
For example:

DATA STORAGE REFERENCE: {CREATE [NAME, ID, TIMESTAMP]}
DATA STORAGE REFERENCE: {RETRIEVE [NAME, ID, TIMESTAMP]}
DATA STORAGE REFERENCE: {UPDATE [NAME, ID, TIMESTAMP]}
DATA STORAGE REFERENCE: {DELETE [NAME, ID, TIMESTAMP]}
